        <p>Youm should list your top 5 albums below.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Kissland</li>
            <li>Take Care</li>
            <li>Blonde</li>
            <li>Sail Out</li>
            <li>East Atlanta Love Letter</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

        <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something </em>in a line of text.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something </strong>in the text.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both.</strong></em></p>

        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

        <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br/>
        Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br/>
        Add a hard line under here, and break the previous two lines using a soft line break.<hr/></p>

        <h2>Images</h2>

        <p>Include the four images from the links and images tutorial below.</p>
        <p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>

        <img src='link-and-images/images/mochi.jpg'/>
        <img src='link-and-images/images/mochi.gif'/>
        <img src='link-and-images/images/mochi.svg'/>
        <img src='link-and-images/images/mochi.png'/>
